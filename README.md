# Accomodation-System

The aim of the project was to design and implement an accomodation booking system for the Univeristy of the West of England, which enables the UWE Accommodation Office to schedule hall activities and keep track of the hall rooms through maintaining the list of room leases by the developed accommodation system.

The developer team has been assignbed with the task of plan, design, develop & test an MVP that utilises;
* OOP principles
* GoF design patterns
* SOLID principles

## Project Description

### Scenario

The main responsibility of the UWE accommodation office is to provide the necessary help 
for all the registered students who are entitled and require their accommodation on-campus.
The on-campus accommodation comprises of many halls of residence, and each hall has a 
number of rooms. The accommodation office has a hall manager who supervises the 
operation of the halls. Each hall has a warden who oversees the regular cleaning and 
maintenance of all the rooms in that hall. Each hall of residence has a name, number, 
address, telephone number. The halls provide only single rooms which have a room number 
and monthly rent rate. The total number of rooms provided by the accommodation office 
should also be available. The hall number uniquely identifies each room in all of the halls 
controlled by the accommodation office, and is used when renting a room to a student. <br/><br/>
The UWE Bristol Accommodation Services allow students renting rooms for the entire 12-
month academic year from September to August. Each individual rental agreement between 
a student and the accommodation office is uniquely identified using a lease number. The 
data stored on each lease includes the lease number, duration of the lease (in months), 
address details of the hall, room number, student’s name and ID number.
The room scheduling is coordinated by the hall manager. That is, the hall manager 
generates and maintains the room schedule, keeps a record of all the students staying in 
the halls and reviews applications for future bookings. The hall manager can edit and view 
room details. The view should show all the detailed information about a single room in a 
hall, including its room number, room status (namely, occupied or unoccupied), monthly 
rent rate and other details describing the room. The hall manager should be able to 
determine from this description whether a particular room is available and its suitability for a 
new student to occupy. On the other hand, a warden can view the room details but he has 
limited editing privileges and can only change a room’s cleaning status which can be “clean”, 
“dirty”, or “off-line”. An off-line room is one that cannot be occupied because it requires 
maintenance beyond a normal cleaning.
